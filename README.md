# PushNotification_Server_iOS_Java


The repository contains code for implementing a sample small scale Push Notification Server which will send notifications to iOS and macOS devices. 

This sample project will lead to more bigger large scale projects for the same to give more scalablity. This is a very simple and straight forward way to implement the Apple Notification System. 

Enthusiasts, who have Java based back-end system and want to make a Push Notification Service, this project can be treated and used a boilerplate. 

All that is needed by enthusiast is a 
1. Push Notification Certificate (.p12)
2. Certificates Password.
3. Device Tokens
4. Physical iOS Device to Test.

Thanks.
